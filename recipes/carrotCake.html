     <h4>Steps</h4>
     <h5>To make the cake:</h5>
     <ol>
         <li>
             Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Spray two 9-inch round 
             cake pans well with non stick cooking spray (you can 
             also line the bottom of each pan with parchment paper for 
             easier removal) and set aside.
         </li>
         <li>
             In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking 
             powder, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and salt 
             until well combined. Set aside.
         </li>
         <li>
             In a separate large mixing bowl, whisk together the oil, 
             eggs, brown sugar, granulated sugar, applesauce, and 
             vanilla extract until fully combined. Add the grated carrots into 
             the wet ingredients and mix until well combined.
         </li>
         <li>
             Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix with a 
             whisk or rubber spatula until just combined, making sure not 
             to over mix the batter.
         </li>
         <li>
             Pour the cake batter evenly between both prepared cake pans. Bake 
             at 350°F for 30-35 minutes or until 
             the tops of the cakes are set and a toothpick inserted 
             into the center of each one comes out clean. Remove 
             from the oven, transfer to a wire rack, and allow to cool 
             in the pans for about 20-25 minutes. Once the cakes have 
             cooled, remove from the pans and return the cakes to the 
             wire rack to finish cooling.
         </li>
     </ol>

     <h5>To make the frosting:</h5>
     <ol>
         <li>
             In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or in a large mixing bowl using a hand-held mixer, beat the cream cheese until smooth. Add the butter and mix for about 30 seconds-1 minute until well combined and smooth. Add in the powdered sugar and vanilla extract and continue mixing until fully combined, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.
         </li>
