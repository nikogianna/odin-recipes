   <h4>Ingredients</h4>
   <ul>
    <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li> 
    <li>2 garlic cloves, finely chopped or grated</li>
    <li>2 tsp ground cumin</li>
    <li>½ tsp chilli flakes</li>
    <li>400g tin kidney beans</li>
    <li>100g/3½oz frozen sweetcorn</li>
    <li>1 lime, ½ juice only and ½ to serve</li>
    <li>4 mini tortilla wraps (see recipe tip)</li>
    <li>40g/1½oz cheddar, grated</li>
    <li>salt and ground black pepper</li>
   </ul>
   
   <h4>Steps</h4>
   <ol>
       <li>
        Heat the oil in a large frying pan and fry the garlic 
        over a medium heat for 2 minutes or until fragrant. 
        Add the cumin and chilli flakes and cook for a further minute. 
       </li>
       <li>
        Add the kidney beans along with the water from the tin and 
        cook for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, use the back 
        of a wooden spoon to mash down half of the beans. 
       </li>
       <li>
        Stir through the sweetcorn and season to taste with the lime 
        juice. Season with salt and pepper. Turn off the heat. 
        Reserve half of this mixture for the Stuffed red peppers recipe (see recipe tip). 
       </li>
       <li>
        To assemble the quesadillas, divide the mixture between two of the 
        tortillas and spread to the edges. Divide the cheese between the 
        two tortillas and top each with a plain tortilla. 
       </li>
       <li>
        Place a clean frying pan over a medium–low heat and cook 
        the quesadilla for 1–2 minutes on each side until crisp 
        and the cheese has melted. Serve with the remaining lime half. 
       </li>
   </ol>
