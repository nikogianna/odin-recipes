    <li>20g/¾oz cornflour</li>
    <li>300ml/10fl oz semi-skimmed milk</li>
    <li>300g/10½oz mixed fish, including smoked haddock, cod and salmon, thawed if frozen</li>
    <li>50g/1¾oz baby spinach leaves</li>
    <li>½ small lemon, finely grated zest only (optional)</li>
    <li>1 thin slice white or brown bread</li>
    <li>15g/½oz Parmesan, finely grated</li>
    <li>sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>100g/3½oz frozen peas, to serve</li>
   </ul>
   
   <h4>Steps</h4>
   <ol>
       <li>
        Place the cornflour into a small bowl and stir in 3 tablespoons 
        of the milk until it forms a smooth paste.
       </li>
       <li>
        Pour the remaining milk into a non-stick saucepan. Add 
        the fish, spinach and lemon zest, if using, 
        to the pan and season with a little salt and pepper. 
        Bring the milk to a gentle simmer and cook for 3–4 
        minutes, or until the fish is beginning to flake, 
        stirring occasionally. 
       </li>
       <li>
        Stir in the cornflour mixture and cook for 1 minute, or 
        until the sauce has thickened. Stir constantly, taking care 
        not to break up the fish pieces too much. Taste and 
        adjust seasoning, if necessary. Spoon into a warmed, 
        shallow flameproof dish or two individual pie dishes. 
       </li>
       <li>
        Preheat the grill to high. Tear the bread into small pieces 
        and toss in a small bowl with the Parmesan. Scatter 
        over the fish.
       </li>
       <li>
        Place the dish or dishes onto a baking tray and place under 
        the hot grill for about 2 minutes, or until the topping 
        is crisp and lightly browned – watch carefully so it doesn’t
        burn.
       </li>
       <li>
        Place the peas into a saucepan of boiling water and cook for 
        2–3 minutes, or according to packet instructions. Drain 
        well and serve immediately with the pie.
       </li>
   </ol>
